#### Notes

1. To have ability to switchon or switchoff you need to run application
as root
2. Little Server Executer is going to be the part
of a new system called Panda's Control Centre
3. This project does not contain the best style of development-code - this is related
to the really important moment: This project is my GTK+Python3 experiment, so later
code will be in a better shape. Arguing about that my absolutely unlogical code -
will be deleted - because I'm well informed about this problem, and it exists only
because of experimenting, and doesn't reflect my tallents. Thank you for your understanding
